# hello-world
This is my first repository  on GitHub created before I even started learning to code.

Radek here. I do not like to code, but spreading science among the general public does not pay much (or at all). 
That is why I decided to storm the coding world and take it by the horns and milk those cash piles lying in front of everyone
willing to code.
